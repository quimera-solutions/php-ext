<h1>Drag and Drop ordering in a TreePanel</h1>
<p>This example shows basic drag and drop node moving in a tree. In this implementation there are no restrictions and 
anything can be dropped anywhere except appending to nodes marked "leaf" (the files).</p>
<p>Drag along the edge of the tree to trigger auto scrolling while performing a drag and drop.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate drag and drop insertion points, sorting was <b>not</b> enabled.</p>
<p>The data for this tree is asynchronously loaded with a JSON TreeLoader.</p>
