# The PHP-Ext Open Source Project #
PHP-Ext is an open source widget library written for PHP 5 to empower the UI Layer.

It is based on [Ext JS 2.0](http://extjs.com) javascript widgets which provide a standard and powerful API to build Rich Internet Applications.  It basically works as a convenient wrapper	for the Ext JS Javascript Objects.

Among other features, PHP-Ext provides useful and common controls to create forms, rich comboboxes, powerful grids and menus.  It also promotes the use of JSON and XML client/server communication to populate forms and grids using Ajax.  Additionally it has a Javascript helper to ease the javascript code generation and use.

This project still under development so keep comming for the final release.  Take a look at the [samples](http://php-ext.quimera-solutions.com/examples), the [API Documentation](http://php-ext.quimera-solutions.com/docs/api) and the [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md) wiki page

Feel free to download the src and samples to try it out and don't forget to write back your comments and suggestions.
