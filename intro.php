	<p class="justified">PHP-Ext is an open source widget library written for PHP 4 and 5 to empower the UI Layer.<br>
	It is based on <a href="http://extjs.com">Ext JS</a> javascript widgets which provide a standard 
	and powerful API to build Rich Internet Applications.  It basically works as a convenient wrapper
	for the Ext JS Javascript Objects.
	</p>
	<p class="justified">Among other features, PHP-Ext provides useful and common controls to create forms, rich comboboxes, powerful grids and menus.
	It also promotes the use of JSON and XML client/server communication to populate forms and grids using Ajax.
	Additionally it has a Javascript helper to ease the javascript code generation and use.
	</p>
